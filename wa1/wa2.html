    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>My aim is to expand my knowledge in software like the Adobe suite, Blender, <br>Unity, and Unreal Engine, while learning new digital tools as they become standard. <br>Software will come and go, so creating the pathways in my brain to keep learning and adapting is critical. <br>Aside from those technical goals, I want to polish my skills as an artist, animator, and video creator.</p>
