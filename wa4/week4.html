    <p>The easy answer for how my color choices reflect my identity is green being my favorite color. 
        There’s more to it than that obviously; the specific bright neon green tint I chose invokes association with a barebones digital landscape. 
        For example, bright green text against a black background was used in the opening credits of The Matrix films, a series about bridging reality and a digitally simulated world. 
        My online identity is deeply important to me, because I’m trying to cultivate an online presence as a digital illustrator. 
        I also just enjoy media like The Matrix, TRON, and Bladerunner, and often let those inspirations shine in my work. 
        I chose the font Expressway because I didn’t want to lean too heavily into the digital landscape aesthetic with a pixelated font. 
        If I did that, I may be mistaken for a programmer instead of an artist. 
        I enjoy the simple, bold, professional look of this sans serif font, which was inspired by Highway Gothic, the font of choice for the US Department of Transportation.</p>
    
    <p>The bright light green contrasts well against the black background, so it’s easy to read. 
        Early computers used light text against a black background because it was simple to display. 
        It’s also much easier on our eyes than a bright white screen. 
        My personal expression in my art is all about being sleek and simple, so making it accessible was fairly intuitive. 
        Making the text colors different in shade and hue while still being exceedingly bright against black was tricky, however.</p>
    
    <p>It surprised me how difficult it was to pick multiple colors for the design system. 
        I almost would have preferred having just the one shade of green, but that would have been too visually bland. 
        Besides, different colors were needed for links and headers. 
        This system should be simple to apply to my portfolio project, I just need to change the navigation menu to buttons and maybe add borders around my art images.</p>
   
    <p>I may add another font or change the biggest header to a bold font to distinguish that styling from the paragraphs. 
        For other contexts, I may change the primary color to blue so it feels less bold and more inviting. 
        The fact that green doesn’t always compliment the art pieces I make causes the system to feel less flexible.</p>
