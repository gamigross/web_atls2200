    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Max (he/him)! I'm a third year student majoring in Media Production and 
        minoring in Creative Technology and Design at University of Colorado Boulder.
    </p>
    <p>I'm passionate about graphic design, illustration, video editing, and 
        3D modeling/animation.</p>
    <h2>GOALS</h2>
    <p>My aim is to expand my knowledge in software like the Adobe suite, Blender, Unity, and Unreal Engine, while learning new digital tools as they become standard. 
        Software will come and go, so creating the pathways in my brain to keep learning and adapting is critical. 
        Aside from those technical goals, I want to polish my skills as an artist, animator, and video creator.
    </p>
