            <h3>Breaking the barrier to HTML</h3>
            <p>This fall, I enrolled in the Web course at CU Boulder to
                fulfill my CTD Minor requirement. So far, I really like my
                instructor and learning assistant. The ideas and history behind
                HTML are explained in lecture, while the actual coding process
                is workshopped during recitation. </p>
            <p>
                Even with my minimal experience in p5.js, the content of the
                course has been simple and comprehensible thus far. I've deployed 
                my first website through GitHub and Visual Studio and learned the 
                importance of a W3C Validator. I look forward to learning past the 
                basics and picking up some styling/formatting skills for web design.

            <h3>Digging into HTML</h3>
            <p>This month, I studied the importance of website accessibility 
                achieved through proper semantic markup. Using HTML elements instead 
                of CS elements for important page content allows screen reader users 
                to cycle through the content of a web page and quickly navigate to the 
                important links and sections.
