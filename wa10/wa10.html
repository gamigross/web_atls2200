        <header>Random Breaking Bad Quotes Except None of These are in Breaking Bad Probably 
            I couldn't find the documentation even after searching through the GitHub
            this is all really confusing so I just went with a basic quote generator :[</header>
        <div class="quotes">
            <p id="quote"></p>
            <p id="author"></p>
        </div>
        <div class="controls">
        <button type="button" class="copy" data-copy="#quote">Copy To Clipboard</button>
        <button type="button" id="new-quote">Get New Quote</button>
        </div>

    <p>The extension I added is a copy text button that allows the user to 
        copy the quote text to their keyboard. Once you click the button, the text content
        of the main quote is copied to your keyboard and the button text changes to let the 
        user know it's been copied. This is a helpful feature if the user finds a quote they like
        and wants to share it.

    <p>I want to use YouTube's video database API in my critique project. I authenticated my key, 
        but I couldn't find a use for it in this week's assignment. I want to use the YouTube API to
        create a search function that allows the user to find videos with key words they typed into the search bar.
        It seems like a somewhat simple thing to code (which is great for me because I have no clue what I'm doing),
        but YouTube doesn't have a search feature that displays more than a few results.
