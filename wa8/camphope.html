      <p class="text" id="about-text">Camp Hope was started by Earl Miller at Buckhorn Camp in 1979 with the focus of Heightening Outdoor Participation for Everyone. Camp Hope strives to provide a quality, Christ-centered outdoor educational experience for all, regardless of ability. 
      Camp Hope provides a camp experience for adults with varying levels of intellectual and physical disabilities. The campsite, program, and activities are modified to meet the needs of the campers. 
      Some of the most popular camp activities include: worship service, crawdad fishing, spa day for the ladies, pinewood derby for the men, a camp talent show, camp fires, a horse show and riding, and many more!

    <header class="head" id="head-2">Our Mission</header>
      <p class="text" id="mission-text">The Purpose of Buckhorn Camp is to provide camping space for and service to our guests. 
        Our guests are groups and individuals who share our values and mission. 
        They are looking for peace-filled experiences and closer relationships with each other or with God, and they respect this space, and one another, embracing the differences that make us whole.
