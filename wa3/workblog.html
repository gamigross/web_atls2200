            <h4>Breaking the barrier to HTML</h4>
            <p>This fall, I enrolled in the Web course at CU Boulder to <br>
                fulfill my CTD Minor requirement. So far, I really like my <br>
                instructor and learning assistant. The ideas and history behind <br>
                HTML are explained in lecture, while the actual coding process <br>
                is workshopped during recitation. <br>
                <br>
                Even with my minimal experience in p5.js, the content of the <br>
                course has been simple and comprehensible thus far. I've deployed <br>
                my first website through GitHub and Visual Studio and learned the <br>
                importance of a W3C Validator. I look forward to learning past the <br>
                basics and picking up some styling/formatting skills for web design.

            <h4>Digging into HTML</h4>
            <p>This month, I studied the importance of website accessibility <br>
                achieved through proper semantic markup. Using HTML elements instead <br>
                of CS elements for important page content allows screen reader users <br>
                to cycle through the content of a web page and quickly navigate to the <br>
                important links and sections.
