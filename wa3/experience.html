        <h3>Warren Tech</h3>
        <h4>2020 to 2022</h4>
        <p>I took two separate year long courses at Warren Tech: Graphic Design and Game Development. 
            <br>
            In Graphic Design and Digital Photography, I learned the fundamentals of
            Photoshop and Illustrator, along with general principles of professional design.
            These included the applications of different file formats, color modes for printable
            files, and direct communication and planning with a client.
            <br>
            <br>
            In Game Development, I learned how to organize and collaborate with my peers on long
            term creative projects. I also used this time to learn programs like ZBrush and Blender
            to model characters optimized for video game applications.
